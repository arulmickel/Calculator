# Calculator â€” History Feature

This branch isolates the **History** feature of DFCalculator.  
It demonstrates how calculation results can be recorded and viewed from a persistent store, separate from the main calculator app.

- **Dialog UI** listing last 50 calculations (`expression = result`)
- Tap a history item â†’ result is copied to clipboard
- Clear history option in the dialog
- Works alongside Dark/Light theme toggle

## How It Works
1. When you press `=`, the app captures the expression and result.
2. The pair is saved into a `SharedPreferences` file as JSON.
3. Pressing **History** in the toolbar opens a dialog:
   - Shows past calculations (most recent first, max 50).
   - Tap an item â†’ result copied to clipboard.
   - "Clear history" removes all entries.
